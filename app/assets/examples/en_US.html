<p class="intro"><b>Arvutaja</b>
(Estonian for "the one that computes") records a speech input,
interprets it as an expression or command, and evaluates it
(or carries it out) using an app on the device. Supported inputs
include
arithmetical expressions,
measurement unit and currency conversion expressions,
alarm clock / timer setting commands.</p>

<h3>Arithmetical expressions</h3>
<p>Arbitrarily long arithmetical expressions with numbers between
-10<sup>12</sup> and 10<sup>12</sup> (including some decimal numbers),
with the main operators ("plus", "minus", "times", "divided by",
"to the power of").</p>

<table>
<tr><td>nine hundred and ninety nine billion nine hundred and ninety nine
million nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
point nine</td></tr>

<tr><td>pie plus one minus two times three divided by four to the power of
five</td></tr>

<tr><td>minus twelve point thirty four plus zero point one hundred and twelve</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Arvutaja computes the result but links to
WolframAlpha for a more detailed analysis.</p>

<h3>Unit conversion</h3>
<p>Unit conversion expressions with about 50 main units and currency conversion
with about 15 currencies.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>convert thirty two point five Fahrenheits to Celsius</td></tr>
<tr><td>convert one hundred point one miles per hours squared to meters per seconds squared</td></tr>
<tr><td>convert two cubic inches to gallons</td></tr>
<tr><td>convert twelve thousand three hundred and forty five Norwegian crowns to Euros</td></tr>
<tr><td>convert half American dollars to New Zealand dollars</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Arvutaja computes the result (unless the expression is a
currency conversion expression)
but links to WolframAlpha for a more detailed analysis.</p>

<h3>Alarm clock and timer</h3>
<p>Commands for setting the alarm clock and the timer.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>set the alarm at seven thirty one</td></tr>
<tr><td>set the timer for fifteen minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>set the timer for two hours and fifteen minutes</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Arvutaja forwards the command to the device's alarm clock app.</p>

<h3>Dialing a number</h3>
<p>Dialing a phone number by listing its digits.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>dial one one eight two</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Arvutaja forwards the command to the device's phone app.</p>


<h2>Variation in the input</h2>
<p>In principle the input must follow the fixed syntactic structure displayed
in the above example sentences, but some variation is supported, e.g. requests can
start with "please" and calculations can be formed by "how much is … in …".</p>

<table>
<tr><td>please set the timer for fifteen minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>please convert one speed of light to meters per second</td></tr>
<tr><td>how much is one speed of light in meters per second</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Other input languages</h2>
<p>Arvutaja supports also <a href="et.html">Estonian language</a> input,
with additional queries such as Estonian address queries.</p>


<h2>See also</h2>
<p>Arvutaja uses grammar-based speech recognition. The grammars are written using the
<a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/">Grammatical Framework</a> and developed
in the <a href="http://kaljurand.github.io/Grammars/">Grammars project</a>.
In addition to many example sentences, also the full source code of the grammars is
available, e.g. to find out which units are available in English look at the source code
of
<a href="https://github.com/Kaljurand/Grammars/blob/master/gf/Unitconv/UnitEng.gf">UnitEng.gf</a>.</p>

<p>Grammar-aware speech recognition is provided by the
<a href="http://kaljurand.github.io/K6nele/">Kõnele app</a>.</p>
